      <h3>BSc : Bachelor's in Science</h3>
      <p>
        BSc or Bachelor of Science is an undergraduate degree of three years
        duration which is universally offered across institutes and universities
        across India. BSc is one of the most popular courses opted by students
        who have a flair for scientific aptitude and zeal for research-oriented
        and calculative approaches based on a proven systematic method. Science
        is all about experimentation, research and discovery. A BSc degree is a
        culmination of both theoretical and practical ways of learning. Pursuing
        a BSc degree also opens up multiple avenues for a student and he/she can
        either opt for higher studies in Science or any other discipline which
        may be related or different from the subjects studied during graduation.
        However, Master of Science (MSc) is the most popular higher education
        alternative opted by students after completing BSc.
